1.6.3:
- Support for new redisInfo format
- Improved interrupt handling during communication
- Minor man page fixes

Significant changes in version 1.6:
- Transactions are supported.
- Pub/sub is supported.
- Better support for raw value types across the board.

Significant changes in version 1.4:
- Many bugs were fixed in the sorted sets (redisZ*) functions.
- New unit tests for sorted set functions were added.

Significant changes in version 1.2:
1. We completely revamped communication with the Redis server, eliminating
   in-line messaging in anticipation of it's demise in future Redis versions.
   We also make a better effort to minimize copying by R prior to sending
   a message.

2. Added support for Redis hashes and ordered sets. The R/Redis client now
   fully supports all Redis types.
